        <p>Hello, my name is Reggie Piet. I am a computer science graduate aspiring to start working in the tech industry. My specialty
          is working with databases, SQL, JavaScript, and Excel. I currently have an analytical role as an ATM technician where I spend
          a significant amount of time trying to determine how much money each machine goes through on a weekly basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time I enjoy playing card, board, and video games with my friends. If nobody is around I like to watch TV shows on
          Netflix. My favorite shows are Breaking Bad and Arrested Development. I also have a strong interest in all types of music,
          ranging from the 1960's to present day. My favorite era of music ranges from the late 1980's to early 1990's when new wave and
          grunge were at their peak. I'm always looking for good songs I haven't heard!
