# Module-2_Assessment
This project is intended to demonstrate
JavaScript's ability to dynamically create
web pages by modifying the front end HTML
and CSS. This particular example is a word
guessing game that accepts keyboard input
from a user and evaluates whether the
letter typed is contained in the randomly
chosen word. I decided to use a space theme
for this project as there are many names
for celestial objects that make ideal
words for a guessing game such as this.
